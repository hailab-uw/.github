# What We Do

We develop novel nanofabricated electromagnetic sensors for minimally invasive recording of brain activity. Our rationale revolves around engineering scalable devices that are versatile enough to record from many locations and generate readouts of a multitude of neural signals. We work on fabricating devices that maintain a stable and strong electrical interface with neurons, achieving high signal recordings without inflicting damage to nerve tissue.

# Open Source Commitment

Our motivation behind using GitHub to share our lab's source code reflects our commitment to furthering science and engineering by releasing our data and models as open-source. Please check back here frequently for new information and code updates.
